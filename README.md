# Restuartant_Database_Order_Analysis

Project Overview:

This project involved the analysis of a relational database, restaurant_db, to uncover key trends within the menu and customer order behavior. I utilized SQL to query two primary tables: menu_items and order_details. The goal was to extract actionable insights regarding item performance and customer preferences.

Business Problem Addressed:

The central business question I aimed to answer was: Which menu items are performing well, and which are underperforming? Additionally, what are the preferred items among our top customers?

Tools and Skills Used:

SQL (MySQL): Proficiently employed advanced SQL techniques, including writing complex queries, utilizing aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT(), AVG(), SUM()), filtering data with WHERE clauses, sorting results using ORDER BY, grouping data with GROUP BY, joining multiple tables, and applying HAVING clauses for post-aggregation filtering.

Data Analysis: Effectively interpreted raw transactional data to identify meaningful patterns and trends.
Problem Solving: Successfully translated business inquiries into efficient and targeted SQL queries to extract the necessary information.

Key Insights:

Pricing Analysis: The analysis revealed that Shrimp Scampi (Italian) is the most expensive item on the menu, while Edamame (Asian) is the least expensive.
Order Frequency: Hamburger (American) emerged as the most frequently ordered item, contrasting with Chicken Tacos (Mexican), which had the lowest order volume.
High-Spending Customer Preferences: The data indicates that Italian dishes are prominent in orders with higher total spending.
